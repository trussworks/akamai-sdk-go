# Akamai SDK for Go

This repository should only be used as reference.

Truss was developing this internally in order to target Akamai's FastDNS v2 API for use in a Terraform provider. Support has since been added by Akamai to their (AkamaiOPEN-edgegrid-golang)[https://github.com/akamai/AkamaiOPEN-edgegrid-golang] repository. While that repository is not written in idiomatic Go, it is what Akamai's official Terraform provider uses. Truss will be trying to upstream changes there from now on.
